# SSL-VQA
This is the official repository for the paper titled " Knowledge Guided Semi-Supervised Learning for Quality Assessment of User Generated Videos" accepted in Proceedings of AAAI conf. on AI (AAAI 24) by Shankhanil Mitra and Rajiv Soundararajan. 

In this work, we address the challenge of requirement of large scale human annotated videos for training by first designing a self- supervised Spatio-Temporal Visual Quality Representation Learning (ST-VQRL) framework to generate robust quality aware features for videos. Then, we propose a dual-model based Semi Supervised Learning (SSL) method specifically designed for the Video Quality Assessment (SSL-VQA) task, through a novel knowledge transfer of quality predictions between the two models.
